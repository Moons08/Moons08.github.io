분명 Easy 단계인데 오랜만에 sql 써보려니 헷갈리던 문제

>Problem

Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

>Sample Input

Let's say that CITY only has four entries: DEF, ABC, PQRS and WXY

>Sample Output

ABC 3<br>PQRS 4

```SQL
SELECT
    city,
    CHAR_LENGTH(city)
FROM STATION
WHERE city = (
    SELECT
        MIN(city)
    FROM STATION
    WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(city) = (
        SELECT
            MIN(CHAR_LENGTH(city))
        FROM STATION
    )
)
OR city = (
    SELECT
        MIN(city)
    FROM STATION
    WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(city) = (
        SELECT
            MAX(CHAR_LENGTH(city))
        FROM STATION
    )
);

```

유저 지정 변수를 이용
- 데이터가 많지 않을 경우에는 오히려 더 오래 걸린다.

```SQL
# find shortest city name
SET @MinCityLen = (SELECT MIN(CHAR_LENGTH(city)) FROM STATION);
# find longest city name
SET @MaxCityLen = (SELECT MAX(CHAR_LENGTH(city)) FROM STATION);

SELECT
    city,
    CHAR_LENGTH(city)
FROM
    STATION
WHERE
    # find shortest city name sorted alphabetically
    city = (
        SELECT
            city
        FROM STATION
        WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(city) = @MinCityLen
        ORDER BY city ASC
        LIMIT 1
    )
    # find longest city name sorted alphabetically
    OR city = (
        SELECT
            MIN(city)
        FROM STATION
        WHERE CHAR_LENGTH(city) = @MaxCityLen
        ORDER BY city ASC
        LIMIT 1
    );
```

쿼리를 두 번 날리는 답안
- 굳이 복잡하게 할 필요 없는 것 같다.
- 아마 출제자도 이 답안을 생각하고 내지 않았을까.

>Note<br>You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query.

```SQL
SELECT name, LENGTH(name) FROM CITY ORDER BY LENGTH(name), name ASC LIMIT 1;
SELECT name, LENGTH(name) FROM CITY ORDER BY LENGTH(name) DESC LIMIT 1;
```
